My goal to make this personal website minimal and beutiful even if I'am not a good designer. I used next.js for this website and velite for the blog. 

<span className='highlight'>Insperation</span> I Insprated for this site a lot from [tnixc.space](https://tnixc.space/) and also [zed.dev](https://zed.dev/).

<span className='highlight'>Features</span>:
- Dynamic OG images for blog posts.
- Vim-inspired keybinds for smooth scrolling [j, k, h, l] + [d, u].
- Quick shortcuts to navigate between main sections.
- Keylogger display.
- Perfect Lighthouse score.

you can find the source code of this website on my [github](https://github.com/neuxq/website).
